/**
 * main - Displays the information contained in the
 *        ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
 * @argc: The number of arguments supplied to the program.
 * @argv: An array of pointers to the arguments, where argv[1] contains the ELF file path.
 *
 * Return: 0 on success.
 *
 * Description: This program takes the path to an ELF file as a command-line argument.
 *              It reads the ELF header from the file and displays various information
 *              from the header, such as magic numbers, class, data, version, OS/ABI, etc.
 *              If the file is not a valid ELF file or if any error occurs during processing,
 *              the program will exit with code 98.
